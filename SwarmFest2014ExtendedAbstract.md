Crypto-economic Design: A Proposed Agent-Based Modeling Effort

By Dave Babbitt, Northwestern University, M.S. (2014, expected) and Joel Dietz, University of Pennsylvania, M.A.

A crypto-economy is an economic system which is 1) not defined by geographic location, political structure or legal system, and 2) uses cryptographic techniques to constrain behaviour (in place of using trusted third parties). The economic agents in these systems can be human-controlled clients and autonomous organizations or contracts. The prices of transacted goods and services in these economies are expressed in a built-in money-like informational commodity and all transactions are recorded on a public ledger.

They are important because they eliminate "bridging" social capital - the building of connections between heterogeneous groups - as a necessary precondition for successful economic development in that you no longer have to trust your valuables to strangers (Schuller, Baron, & Field, 2000).

Crypto-economies have more than a need for software and security testing - they need to have their economies tested. Adding to the complexity of the cryptosystem that a crypto-economy is based on is the fact that exchanging value necessarily involves economic considerations. Therefore crypto-economies must be analyzed not only for computational soundness and security, but also for economic soundness and security (Poelstra, 2014). That is, the crypto-economy must be designed so that the incentives are aligned with the goal of strengthening the security of the system.

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) often results in what is called "weak emergence" - the appearance of new properties not fully reducible to that of the micro-properties on which it supervenes, but derivable only by simulation (Bedau, 1997). It is this weak emergence and the relative ease of capturing the salient aspects of the actual system that allows the development of crypto-economy-specific test scaffolding.

Economic analysis of crypto-economies exposes various public goods issues that typically happen to a communal effort in danger of being lobbied by special interest groups.  These public goods issues include 1) the financial incentives for operating a centralized mining pool, 2) the centralization of infrastructure without the benefits of centralization (i.e., lower transaction costs, efficiencies of scale), and 3) the lack of financial incentives for working as a developer.

Capturing the salient aspects of the crypto-economic system is a matter of dividing the economic agents into clusters. The "speculators" and "miscreants", for instance, can be modeled as standard profit-seeking economic agents. And the open code sources of crypto-currencies can be written almost character for character into the agents built for the test.

The "altruists" and "hostiles" are the hardest clusters to model. The altruists can be modeled with information cascades, where an agent observes the actions of others and then — despite possible contradictions in its own private information signals — engages in the same acts. augmented by the media hype cycle. The hostiles are custom-made as security exploits are theoretically discovered.

The first economists to study Bitcoin have attempted to discover what individual incentives exist without the use of agent-based models (ABMs). We conclude that these issues would've been readily apparent ("low hanging fruit") with the use of ABMs and that if you run an economic simulation of the design ahead of time, you will at least have a model-based exploration method to find the big issues.
